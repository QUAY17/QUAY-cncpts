			<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The objective of my Personal Website (PWP) is to visually and efficiently market my web development skills and introduce my company Quay.cncpts. I want to give the viewer a better understanding of who I am in hopes of obtaining future contracts in this field! The challenge I am attempting is strategically marrying my previous career in product design with my current position in web development.</p>
			<p>I want to captivate any potential clientele viewing my site with awareness and interest! This should be done with a site that appears professional and versatile but also reflecting my personal style. In the spirit of networking and collaboration, I would also like for my site to attract and invite other developers to contact me!</p>
			<p>Ultimately, I want my site to advertise my web development business platform in addition to my previous design career. I want to maintain a high- end aesthetic suitable for design minded clients who might (or might not) be more visually inclined, have a design/ innovation to advertise, an image/ video gallery focus, or a product to sell. In short, encapsulating my goals as "Design & Development" services. </p>
