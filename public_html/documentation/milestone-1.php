			<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The objective of my Personal Website (PWP) is to visually and efficiently market my web development skills and introduce my company Quay.cncpts. I want to give the viewer a better understanding of who I am in hopes of obtaining future contracts in this field! The challenge I am attempting is strategically marrying my previous career in product design with my current position in web development.</p>
