			<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The objective of my Personal Website (PWP) is to visually and efficiently market my web development skills and introduce my company Quay.cncpts. I want to give the viewer a better understanding of who I am in hopes of obtaining future contracts in this field! The challenge I am attempting is strategically marrying my previous career in product design with my current position in web development.</p>
				<p>I want to captivate any potential clientele viewing my site with awareness and interest! This should be done with a site that appears professional and versatile but also reflecting my personal style. In the spirit of networking and collaboration, I would also like for my site to attract and invite other developers to contact me!</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I want my site to advertise my web development business platform in addition to my previous design career. I want to maintain a high- end aesthetic suitable for design minded clients who might (or might not) be more visually inclined, have a design/ innovation to advertise, an image/ video gallery focus, or a product to sell. In short, encapsulating my goals with "Design & Development" services. </p>
			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p>Mark Baker, founder of BAKER ARCHITECTURE + DESIGN, owner of Humble COFFEE</p>
			<p>Mark integrates his philosophy into all of his ventures: creating modern solutions by utilizing contemporary materials and technologies. His portfolio demonstrates his modelling of open- spaces; considering light, sound, comfort, interaction, portability, and fabrication.</p>
			<p>Mark is opening a new brewery in Albuquerque after the major success of his craft coffee shop on Lomas Blvd., which is cleverly attached to his work studio (Baker A + D, founded in 2002). Both are small, yet cutting edge local businesses and use advanced technology at every stage of production. (iPad POS systems at the cafe, advanced drafting and 3D modeling/rendering at the studio).
			<p>--This happens to be a perfect intersection of client persona and my development goals. The opportunity to obtain contracts with affluent, design- minded clients with similar interests is a major plus. Sharing common ground with clients is a gigantic advantage and integral to "bridging the gap" of the project direction. Meaning (hopefully), that the client gets what they want quicker with fewer revisions!--
			<p>Ideally, Mark would reference my site, love it :), and contact me regarding the development of the new website needed for his brewery! Hopefully, this would cultivate a beautiful business relationship in which I handled all his future web development needs and possibly guest design on architectural projects. lolz!
