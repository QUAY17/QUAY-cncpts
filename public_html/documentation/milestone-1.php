			<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>The objective of my Personal Website (PWP) is to visually market my web development skills and introduce my company Quay.cncpts. I want to give the viewer a better understanding of who I am in hopes of obtaining future contracts in this field! The challenge is to strategically bridge  my previous career in product design to my current position in web development.</p>
				<p>I want to captivate the attention of any potential clientele viewing my site with interest and awareness! This should be done with a site that appears professional and versatile but also reflecting my personal style. In the spirit of networking and collaboration, I would also like for my site to attract and invite other developers to contact me!</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I want my site to market my web development business platform in addition to my design services. I want to maintain a high- end aesthetic suitable for design minded clients who might (or might not be) visually inclined, have a design/ innovation to advertise, an image/ video gallery to display, or a product to sell. In short, offering "Design & Development" services. </p>
			<h2>Persona</h2>
				<p>Mark Baker, founder of BAKER ARCHITECTURE + DESIGN, owner of Humble COFFEE</p>
				<p>Mark integrates this philosophy into all of his ventures: creating modern solutions by utilizing contemporary materials and technologies. His portfolio demonstrates his modelling of open- spaces; considering light, sound, comfort, interaction, portability, and fabrication.</p>
				<p>Mark is opening a new brewery in Albuquerque after the major success of Humble, his craft coffee shop on Lomas Blvd., which is cleverly attached to his work studio (Baker A + D, founded in 2002). Both are small, yet cutting edge local businesses and use advanced technology at every stage of production. (iPad POS systems at the cafe, advanced drafting and 3D modeling/rendering at the studio).
				<p>--This happens to be a perfect intersection of client persona and my personal goals as a developer. The opportunity to obtain contracts with affluent, design- minded clients with similar interests is a major plus. Sharing common ground with clients is a gigantic advantage and integral to "bridging the gap" of the project direction. Meaning (hopefully), that the client gets what they want quicker with fewer revisions!--
			<h2>Use Case</h2>
				<p>I have contacted Mark directly during regular business hours via email expressing my interest of working on his new brewery's website. I provide him with a link to my website and portfolio which he accesses quickly on his mac desktop at his studio. Ideally, Mark would reference my site and love it :)! Hopefully, this would cultivate a beautiful business relationship in which I handled all his future web development needs and possibly guest design on future architectural projects. lolz! </p>
