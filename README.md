## Milestone 1 Feedback
Very thoughtful and well-crafted documentation here - nice work. You have a clear and well-defined direction outlined, which will serve you well as you begin the design phase of the site.

It's nice to see that you have a very clear and thorough understanding of the audience you are designing for. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape. 

Your Persona could use more detail regarding technology. Devices and network connections, software, technical skill, etc. Your persona Mark sounds like a moderately tech-savvy Mac and iPhone user, so he may appreciate a special kind of navigation or something on the mobile view - just a thought. And the full range of iOS compatible favicons, of course! See [http://realfavicongenerator.net/](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)

Your directory structure is set up correctly and your code looks good - just watch your indentation.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Nice work.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- watch indentation in your HTML

## Milestone2a

You did an amazing job on milestone2a. The content strategy is clear and to the point, and your wireframes are very detail oriented. I can already envision your site. I only saw a few things that are concerning. First, I would recommend putting all needed navigations links into the hamburger button, doing this will give you a much cleaner UI on mobile devices. Second I am a little confused with the content blobs on the desktop wireframe is this where each section you defined in the content strategy will go? If so I recommend that you make sure the content blobs can easily reposition depending on the screen size. For the portfolio thumbnails I would recommend using swipebox or flickity. Dont forget you need a contact form somewhere

### Grade Tier IV

## Milestone 2&beta; Feedback
Nice work so far - detailed notes from our meeting left via Slack. Your Milestone passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice job! :D

## Milestone 3 / Final PWP Feedback
Congratulations on creating an absolutely beautiful PWP. Your design and layout looks great on mobile and desktop screens, and your contact form appears to work perfectly well on my end so check and see if you got my test message.

I noted some suggestions below for some final polish. Excellent job here - your PWP passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

### Suggestions
- Since the hamburger button only functions on small/mobile screens - I would hide it on the sm breakpoint on up. Have a look at Bootstrap's Responsive Utility classes.
- There's a small horizontal scrollbar along the bottom on mobile view, so your HTML structure and/or CSS might need a slight adjustment.
- Consider some custom jQuery for a smooth scrolling effect when a user clicks on a link.
- Also consider opening your resume link in a new tab using the `target="_blank"` attribute on the <a> tag.
