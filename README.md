## Milestone 1 Feedback
Very thoughtful and well-crafted documentation here - nice work. You have a clear and well-defined direction outlined, which will serve you well as you begin the design phase of the site.

It's nice to see that you have a very clear and thorough understanding of the audience you are designing for. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape. 

Your Persona could use more detail regarding technology. Devices and network connections, software, technical skill, etc. Your persona Mark sounds like a moderately tech-savvy Mac and iPhone user, so he may appreciate a special kind of navigation or something on the mobile view - just a thought. And the full range of iOS compatible favicons, of course! See [http://realfavicongenerator.net/](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)

Your directory structure is set up correctly and your code looks good - just watch your indentation.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Nice work.
